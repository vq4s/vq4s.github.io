  <h1> About Me: </h1>
  <p>
    I'm Łukasz — a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong focus on web application security.<br>
    I enjoy solving machines on platforms like <strong>HackTheBox</strong>, <strong>TryHackMe</strong>, and similar CTF-style environments, where I constantly improve my practical skills in ethical hacking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of my work revolves around discovering and understanding web vulnerabilities, writing walkthroughs, and exploring various aspects of offensive security.<br>
    This blog is my space to share what I learn along the way.
